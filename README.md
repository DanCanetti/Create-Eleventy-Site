# Create Eleventy site

Create an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) website directly in your Repo.

To use go to the actions tab and run the action.

## What is created

- An `.eleventyignore` file which ignores the `README.md` file and `assets` directory.
- An `.eleventy.js` file which sets the output directory to `docs` - perfect for GitHub Pages use
- A README.md file
- A `partials` directory and all the partial `.scss` files that I usually use. I use NodeSass to compile these.
- An `assets` directory, I usually keep all my design and source files in here.
